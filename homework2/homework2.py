# absolute path goes from the home directory, relative path goes from where you are at the moment.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2". 
# absolute: ~/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
# relative: ../course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
